# Cache Implementation 

I need to implement caching with background revalidation for my [FRAMEWORK] app. Help me:

1. Set up a cache layer that stores [DATA_TYPE] locally
2. Create functions to read from cache instantly on app load
3. Implement background sync to update cache with fresh data
4. Handle cache invalidation when data becomes stale
5. Show fallback loading states only for cache misses

My current data flow: [DESCRIBE_CURRENT_FLOW]
My stack: [LIST_TECHNOLOGIES]

Provide complete code examples with error handling and cache expiration logic.
